Foodle: A Food Delivery App
Foodle is a full-featured, responsive food delivery application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Stripe payment integration. The platform is designed to provide a seamless experience for customers, administrators, and delivery personnel, combining an intuitive frontend, a robust backend, and an easy-to-use admin panel into a single, comprehensive system.

Features
Customer Interface (Frontend)
Responsive Design: Built with React, Foodle offers a fully responsive interface that adapts to various devices, ensuring an optimized experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing sessions and protecting user data.
Browse and Search: Customers can browse restaurants, view menus, and search for food items by category, popularity, or dietary preferences.
Order Management: Users can place orders, choose delivery addresses, and track the status of their orders in real-time.
Payment Integration: With Stripe, users can make secure and hassle-free payments within the app.
Admin Panel
User Management: Admins can view and manage user accounts, including customer and delivery personnel details.
Menu and Restaurant Management: Easily add, edit, or delete food items, categories, and restaurant details to keep offerings up to date.
Order Tracking: Real-time monitoring of active and past orders with controls to update order status (e.g., received, in-progress, completed, delivered).
Analytics: Track key metrics like popular items, order frequency, and user activity to make informed decisions and improve service quality.
Backend (Server)
API Development: Built with Express.js, the backend provides RESTful APIs to handle requests, manage authentication, and link the frontend with the MongoDB database.
Data Storage: MongoDB stores user profiles, order details, restaurant data, and menu items in a scalable and efficient way.
Real-Time Updates: Real-time updates for users about order statuses via WebSockets.
Security: Endpoints are secured with encrypted user information, and payment processing is safely handled via Stripe.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React, CSS3, Bootstrap/Material UI for styling, and Stripe integration for payment processing.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js, and WebSockets for real-time updates.
Database: MongoDB for efficient, scalable data storage.
Payment Integration: Stripe for secure and seamless payment processing.
